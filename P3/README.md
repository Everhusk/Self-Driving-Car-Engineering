#****Behavioral Cloning****

# Problem Description

Using image data and steering angles, use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. Train, validate and test the model using Keras. Then use this model to drive a car autonomously around a race track. [1]

# Problem Solution

TODO

## High Level Overview

The pipeline used to solve this problem consists of the following N steps:

1. Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
2. Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
3. Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
4. Summarize the results with a written report
