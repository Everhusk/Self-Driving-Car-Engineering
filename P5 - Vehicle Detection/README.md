# **Vehicle Detection**

Write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video stream. Please refer to the [python notebook](https://github.com/Everhusk/Self-Driving-Car-Engineering/blob/master/P5/solution.ipynb) for details.
To solve this problem, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system called YOLO (You only look once) was implemented and applied to the test images/video.
